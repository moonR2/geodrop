## Installation

You can use your preferred package manager, in my case I used npm.
(Note: You need to use Node v18 or higher)

```sh
npm install
```

## Basic scripts

### To run the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

### To run the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

## Deployment

At the moment the application is deployed in Vercel with the following address https://geodrop-nine.vercel.app/
I may have to shut down the app due to the cost of the Google Maps API.
